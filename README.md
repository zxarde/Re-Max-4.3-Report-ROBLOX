# Re-Max4.3, THIS ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS, IDK IF ITS FOR MAC
Hello there, i created an report bot for roblox! It is very fast and report 10 people in a second, using a nanosecond fast and secure proxy.     

IMPORTANT: You need these packages installed: 
1. "gradient-string"
2. "prompt-sync"
3. "html-loader"

IMPORTANT: You also need Node.js in order for the application to work.

You can install node.js here: https://nodejs.org/en/

You can install the following like this:
1. npm i gradient-string
2. npm install --save prompt-sync-history
3. npm install --save-dev html-loader

After that follow the step on how to run the file.

How to run?
1. Download the JS file. 
2. Put it in any Directory.
3. Open Terminal
4. Navigate to the directory of the FILE. BUT DONT SELECT THE FILE. THE DIRECTORY IS THE PARENT OF THE FILE (cd "Your Directory")
5. Run the node command with the file: ("node Remax-4.3.js")
6. If that didn't work, try this: ("node C:\Users\yourname\directory\Remax-4.3.js")
