# Re-Max-4.3-Report-ROBLOX
Hello there, i created an report bot for roblox! It is very fast and report 10 people in a second, using a nanosecond fast and secure proxy.     

IMPORTANT: You need these packages installed: 
1. "gradient-string"
2. "prompt-sync"
3. "html-loader"

How to run?
1. Download the file. 
2. Put it in any Directory.
3. Open Terminal
4. Navigate to the directory of the FILE. BUT DONT SELECT THE FILE. THE DIRECTORY IS THE PARENT OF THE FILE (cd "Your Directory")
5. Run the node command with the file: ("node Remax-4.3.js")
6. If that didn't work, try this: ("node C:\Users\yourname\directory\Remax-4.3.js")
